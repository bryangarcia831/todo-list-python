# todo-list-python

### Project Details
Python Flask Webpage for a TODO list with AWS/MYSQL Backend. Using SQLAlchemy for database connection as well as object mapping.

Going to be used for personal use. Added [SQL files](https://github.com/bryangarcia831/todo-list-python/tree/master/Resources) to create DB as well as fake copy of properties ([properties_text.ini](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bryangarcia831/todo-list-python/master/properties_test.ini)) to show how I used that.
